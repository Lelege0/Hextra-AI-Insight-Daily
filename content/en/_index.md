### Frontier Research
1.  **GPT-5** has quietly transformed into a 'cross-disciplinary scientist,' now tackling cutting-edge fields like mathematics, physics, and medicine 🤯. According to the [latest research report (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1p31izw/new_research_shows_how_ai_could_transform_math/) co-authored by OpenAI and external scientists, the model is helping humanity explore complex topics from black hole mysteries to anti-cancer cells, and even solving tricky math puzzles. This suggests AI isn't just a tool anymore; it could become a powerful partner accelerating scientific discovery. Who knows, a future Nobel Prize might even have an AI's name on it! 🏆

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  **Shanghai Baoshan** is hosting a 'robot revolution' with a grand intelligent robotics industry conference kicking off, bringing together leaders from government, industry, academia, and research! This conference not only unveiled an ambitious action plan for the **humanoid robot** industry but also launched a supply chain platform and data collection center. The goal? To forge a complete ecosystem for the robotics industry, from R&D to application. This marks Baoshan's all-out sprint to become a new powerhouse on the national robotics industry map. [Click to read about the conference (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-11-22-8) and see what's heating up! 🔥

2.  **AI's massive demand for memory** is here, and for all you 'waiting-party' folks, your PC build plans might just be toast! 💸 Samsung recently announced a whopping 60% price hike for **DRAM**, with the culprit being AI data centers' insatiable hunger for high-end memory like **HBM**. This directly squeezes consumer market capacity, sending assembly costs for gamers and DIY enthusiasts through the roof. This isn't just simple market fluctuation; it reflects a structural shock from the AI industry to the global hardware supply chain. [Check out this popular (AI News) article](https://newshacker.me/story?id=45934619)—looks like your graphics cards and RAM won't be getting cheaper anytime soon! 😭

3.  **OpenAI** has dropped what many are calling the 'future bible for engineering teams' – an [official guide (AI News)](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/building-an-ai-native-engineering-team.pdf) that declares the 'old gods' of software development are out, and 'new gods' are in! 🤯 Its core idea: coding agents will take over 80% of development work, shifting human engineers' core value from 'writing code' to 'defining problems, designing systems, and steering direction.' The guide thoroughly breaks down the new workflow of **Delegate → Review → Own**, signaling that a productivity revolution in the software industry is here. Time for engineers to level up their skill trees! 🚀<br/>![AI News: AI-Native Engineering Team New Paradigm](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01kap024c4es1bkc7swyby9qe5.avif)<br/>![AI News: OpenAI's Engineering Guide](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01kap027s7e8jafa9jpzhh4ees.avif)

### Open Source TOP Projects
1.  **Huawei** has just dropped a bombshell, open-sourcing its AI container technology called **Flex:ai**, specifically designed to cure all sorts of computing power waste syndromes! 💪 This tech merges different types of computing chips, like **GPUs** and **NPUs**, into a 'computing power pool,' then meticulously divides and intelligently schedules them. Reportedly, it boosts computing power utilization by 30%, making sure both small model training and large model inference get the most bang for their buck. 💰 [Learn about this (AI News) here](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-11-22-2)—it's seen as a direct challenge to Nvidia's Run:ai and is expected to give a massive shot in the arm to the domestic computing power ecosystem.
