# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (also known as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. Cheers! ✨

## 1. About Our Services
**Our Services** are all about giving you access to paid subscription content and exclusive membership perks. Think blog posts, unique resources, e-books, and even community interactions! Some of this awesome content is exclusively for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Accounts**: To snag one, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account – that's a big no-no!
- **The Site** holds the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're caught breaking these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden fees, promise!
- **All payments** go through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal – you know the drill!). Don't worry, **the Site never stores your payment info**. We're not about that. 🔒
- **Your subscription** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Heads up! 🔔
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Each user gets one shot at this! After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless mandated by law. Sorry, folks! 🤷‍♀️

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our express permission. Got it? 🧐
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access this content for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, pal!
- **For commercial use** or if you need to cite a lot, please hit up the Site to get authorization. We're usually pretty cool, just ask! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users are strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice, or don't play at all! 🚫
- **Also, don't even think about** using technical means to mass download, scrape, or hack our member content. That's a definite no-go! 🙅‍♂️
- **The Site** has the right to remove any inappropriate content and will **ban users who violate these rules**. Seriously, we're not messing around. 😤

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
- **The Site** is **not liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or interruptions from third-party services. Sometimes stuff just happens, you know? 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information** provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Don't take our word as gospel for serious stuff!
- **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might experience from using our content or services. Basically, use at your own risk, folks! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Keepin' it Californian! 🌴
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms? We're all about friendly negotiations first! But if that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. So, you know, lawyers and stuff. ⚖️
