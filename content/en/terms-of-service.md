# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "**the Site**" or "**we**" from now on). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By visiting or using the Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms. 😉

## 1. What We Offer
The Site offers paid subscription content and member services, including (but not limited to!) blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To register an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set a password.
*   Users are responsible for the security of their account and all activities under it. Seriously, don't transfer or share your account – it's a big no-no! 🚫
*   The Site reserves the right to suspend or terminate a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the Site doesn't store your payment info. We keep things secure! 🔒
*   Subscriptions will automatically renew unless you cancel before the end of your current billing cycle.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy:** For first-time subscribers, if you're not happy with the service, you can apply for a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one shot at a refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are non-refundable unless legally required. No exceptions!

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday). No copying, reprinting, or commercial use is allowed without authorization. Play fair! ✨
*   Users only get non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights, specifically for personal learning and reading.
*   For commercial use or extensive citations, please contact the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   It's strictly forbidden to upload, post, or spread any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep it clean! 😇
*   Do not, under any circumstances, use technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content. Seriously, don't try to loophole it! 🙅‍♀️
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and ban violating users. We mean business! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up!
*   The Site will not be liable for compensation if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control! 🌧️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and does not constitute any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). We're not pros in those fields! 🤓
*   The Site is absolutely not responsible for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk! 😉

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved by friendly negotiation. If negotiation fails, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
